# LivePin (F25 ECE Capstone)

LivePin is a real-time 3D visualization system developed as part of the Fall 2025 ECE Capstone (Team B6). The system converts depth images into a physical, touchable display using a 32×32 array of actuated pins. By combining depth sensing, embedded systems, and mechanical actuation, LivePin enables interactive exploration of 3D shapes in the physical world.
